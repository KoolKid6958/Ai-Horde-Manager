This will be a manager for the [Ai Horde](https://aihorde.net/).

The main goal of this project is to simplify starting an image worker, so instead of the somewhat tedious process you currently need to do, this project will automatically detect the optimal settings for your hardware, and configure it as such. 

After that, the other goals are being able to manage the client(s) from one interface, so being able to configure settings, see kudos, etc, all over the network.

Currently there is no code yet, but ill add start instructions when there is.
